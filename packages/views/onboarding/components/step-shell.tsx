/**
 * Shared geometry for the onboarding steps, so four screens the member sees
 * back-to-back cannot drift apart again. They already had: the headers were
 * flush to the window edge while the content columns were centred, which was
 * invisible while a 480px rail absorbed the difference and became a 267px
 * misalignment the moment the rail came out.
 *
 * Three pieces, and the split between them is the point:
 *
 *   - STEP_GUTTER is the only place horizontal padding lives. Keeping it off
 *     the measured element is what stops the reading width from jumping at a
 *     breakpoint — with padding inside a max-w box, `md` and `lg` resolve to
 *     different content widths for the same box.
 *   - STEP_FRAME is the persistent chrome measure. Back and the step
 *     indicator sit on it, identically, on every step, so the one element
 *     that survives every transition never moves.
 *   - STEP_COLUMN is the reading measure for prose and forms. A step may use
 *     the frame instead when its content genuinely needs the width (the
 *     questionnaire's option grid does); both are centred, so the content
 *     stays on the frame's centreline either way.
